    <!-- Introduction to the recipe. -->
    <h2>Delicious Spaghetti Bolognese</h2>
    <p>The Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour. It's perfect for a quick midweek meal but even better if you can simmer it for a couple of hours!</p>

     <h3>Method</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
        <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
        <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 - 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 - 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. </li>
        <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti - though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
     </ol>
